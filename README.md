# simple-cuda-dl-framework
A simple CUDA-acclerated deep learning framework for educational use.

Scripts in `baseline` run the baseline framework *pytorch* for linear regression and binary classification tasks.

Inside `code` are the main components of the framework. These codes can *only* run with GPUs. 

We suggest using Visual Studio 2022 with CUDA 12.8 for testing.
